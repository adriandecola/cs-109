Please note the instructor permission was given to share this code.

This is code from my first course in computer science: Introduction to Programming. The course was taught my one of my favorite professors, Barry Lawson, at Bates College. I had seen peers use software to solve systems of equations in my physics classes, build games in terminal, and to shortcut statistical analysis in economics courses. I had believed that all things computational were above my head and avoided them. After struggling with to use Stata in my economics courses and knowing that foundation in programming would be helpful to my studies, I decided to take this course. I soon found the same meaningful stimulation in this course as my Physics courses and knew it was something I wanted to continue to pursue. The course gave me the background and confidence to pursue much more meaningful and technical Physics and Economics problems. It also inspired me not to write myself off on daunting endeavors and question other areas where I had been doing the same such thing. The course was a monumental growing point both academically and personally.

I'll add some coursework for memory. My proudest project from this course was certainly the final project which included a class that held image data and adding methods to edit the picture throught an interface (created by my professor) called "FauxtoShop.py". Some methods took hours of thought to create and I had a blast solving creating them. 

All this code can be run in any Python enviroment.
